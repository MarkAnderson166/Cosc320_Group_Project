### A short one paragraph summary of the project
```
Senior management of student services at UNE are looking to automate some of the processes they use to determine degree completion road maps for students. At the moment this is a manual process that takes some time to complete. The hope is to automate at least the simpler cases. The more complex may be a future project that will build on your process that will be developed. 
This should be an interesting project, as it will have a design and implementation stages that individual students may complete. It will be interesting to see how successful it is.
