## Client name and contact details

Client: Student Services at UNE.  
Contact: Timothy Bartlett-Taylor - tbartle4@une.edu.au  

## A short one paragraph summary of the project

The client requires a working prototype to enable students to complete a self-check to see where they are up to within their degree.
Currently this is a manual process and the client would like this automated. The platform should allow for students to input the units 
they have passed, along with any advanced standing credits, and after selecting a course version, the tool would output the remaining
units required to fulfill their degree. 

~~Senior management of student services at UNE are looking to automate some of the processes 
they use to determine degree completion road maps for students. At the moment this is a 
manual process that takes some time to complete. The hope is to automate at least the 
simpler cases. The more complex may be a future project that will build on your process 
that will be developed. 
This should be an interesting project, as it will have a design and implementation stages 
that individual students may complete. It will be interesting to see how successful it is.
Choose an individual to contact the client, -Eddie~~

## Specification of client requirements (e.g. in terms of software deliverables, functionality).
- Ability for student to enter their current progress
- ie, the units they have already passed along with any advanced standing credits applied
- also, enter the units that they are planning to do
- this will be done via  web front end, possible a mobile app if there is time

- the student will also select their course version, from a list of those available for processing
