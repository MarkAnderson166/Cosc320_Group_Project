## A summary of project outcomes

The brief from the client was to create a system that could automate a process that determines a degree completion roadmap for a student.  By developing a prototype system using a few of the simpler course curriculums we are able to show the client that this objective is possible.

Students would be able to use this system directly without any intervention from the client which would allow them to obtain a quick turnaround. Also, this would free up valuable staff resources at the client as they are not having to perform time-consuming manual interpretations of the student’s degree.

No only can the student see how far they have progressed, the are able to plan their future course enrollment by using the flexible “drag-and-drop” Roadmap Designer functionality. The student can use calendar functionality to decide which units they want to complete in each trimester. This interactive feature makes it very easy for the student to look at various “what-if” scenarios. Alternatively they are able to use a system generated roadmap by using the recommended options
